This a Ruby on Rails web application to help manage trips.

I started developing with a genuine business reason and a learning one. On one side, I needed to manage my trips and at that time I couldn't find any similar application. It turns out there is at least one application called Tripit that does some of the ideas I had in mind. On the other side, I wanted to learn and practice Ruby on Rails.

For some time I've been using the site for my own trips. Now I've decided to learn a new technique, and the site is no longer going to be used. So I've decided to open the code.

I doubt it will be of any use to anyone, but the app is Apache Licensed.
